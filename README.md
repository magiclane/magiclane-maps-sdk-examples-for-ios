# Magic Lane - Maps SDK for iOS demo applications

This repository holds a series of example projects using the **Magic Lane - Maps SDK for iOS**. More information about the API can be found on the [Documentation](https://developer.magiclane.com/docs/ios) page.

This set of individual, use-case based projects are designed to be cloned by developers for their own use.

**Note:** As the very first step, we highly recommend that you get a token from [Magic Lane Portal](https://developer.magiclane.com/api). If no token is set, you can still test your apps, but a watermark will be displayed, and all the online services including mapping, searching, routing, etc. will slow down after a few minutes.
